    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p><b>Gymnastics: </b>I just concluded my 9 year competitive gymnastics career this fall. My favorite event is
        balance beam.</p>

    <p><b>Coaching: </b>I have been coaching gymnastics for about 6 years. My favorite level to coach is high school
        varsity.</p>

    <p><b>Puppy Time: </b>I have a one year old weiner dog named Sunny. I love to cuddle with her, play with her, and
        dress her up.</p>

    <p><b>Nail Art: </b>I started getting interested in nail art last year and would digitally create designs for a nail
        tech to paint on my nails. Last month I started painting my designs myself.</p>

    <p><b>Travelling: </b>I like to travel and lately I've been enjoying capturing my travel moments on video. I like to
        edit my travel clips into one video to post on my TikTok.</p>
