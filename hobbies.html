            <p><b>Gymnastics: </b>I just concluded my 9 year competitive gymnastics career this fall. My favorite event
                is balance beam.</p>

            <p><b>Coaching: </b>I have been coaching gymnastics for about 6 years. My favorite level to coach is high
                school varsity.</p>

            <p><b>Puppy Time: </b>I have a one year old weiner dog named Sunny. I love to cuddle with her, play with
                her, and dress her up.</p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Nails: </b>I started getting interested in nail art last year, and I used to pay nail tech to paint on
                my nails. Recently, I started painting my designs myself and posting results on Pinterest.</p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Fashion: </b>I enjoy following the latest fashion trends and documenting my outfits every day in the
                StyleBook app. To reduce my person impact on textile waste, I resell my used clothes on Mercari when I'm
                done with them.</p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Music: </b>I love listening to music, and have been making monthly playlists on Spotify every month
                for over seven years. My top genre is usually Pop.</p>
